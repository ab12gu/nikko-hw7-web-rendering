            <p>
                Sage is small shrub and a member of the mint family. It is of Kingdom Plantae, Family Lamiaceae, Genus Salvia, Species S. officinalis. The plant is native to the Eastern Mediterranean and Southern Europe, but has played a role in Greek, Roman, Native American, and Chinese herbal remedies through the ages.
            </p>
    
            <p> 
                Concentrated forms of sage, like sage oil, can be harmful if ingested, but the plant itself is not toxic to humans, dogs, or cats when taken in moderation. Salvia officinalis contains antioxidants, and has been said to alleviate symptoms of <strong>menopause, high blood sugar, and respiratory issues</strong>.
            </p>
            <p class="cooking"> 
                Sage can also be a delicous cullinary addition. Sage butter is one of the easiest ways to elevate pastas and meats. It can be made by bringing butter to a low simmer in a saucepan and dropping in enough safe leaves to cover half the surface. Keep the pan on a low heat at all times to ensure no leaves are burnt in the process. Once you see crystallization beginning on the leaves, remove the saucepan from heat and turn off the stove.

            <p>Basil, like Sage, is of the mint family Lamiaceae. While there are many variants of the herb, Ocimum basilica ("great basil" or common basil) was originally born from the hot, wet, tropical regions along the Indian Ocean-- areas near the Arabian Sea, Bay of Bengal, Andaman Sea and the Gulf of Thailand. In a garden, this plant can tolerate slightly cooler temperatures, like Mediterranean climates.</p>
            <p> Basil can reduce stress, depression, memory loss associatted with aging (in India, Tulsi is thought to be a brain-enhancing substance). It has also been said to act as an antibacterial and to protect against substances that can damage one's gut. </p>
            <p class="cooking"> <strong>Did you know</strong>: Basil can be kept in a freezer for long periods if it is blanched first (dipping the leaves quickly into boiling water). </p>
